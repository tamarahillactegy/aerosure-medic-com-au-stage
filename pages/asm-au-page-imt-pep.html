    <h1>IMT &amp; PEP</h1>

    <h3 style="margin: 0.5em 0;font-size: 1.5em;color: #005ea1;">The only all-in-one drug-free respiratory device</h3>

    <p>Aerosure Medic works by spinning a valve inside the device at high speed to rapidly open and close the flow of air in and out of the lungs. As you breathe though the mouth piece, the spinning valve creates resistance, vibrating the chest wall to work the lung muscles harder. This therapy technique is designed to strengthen the lungs to reduce breathlessness.</p>

    <h3 style="margin: 1.5em 0 0.5em;font-size: 1.5em;color: #005ea1;">Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) &amp; Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP)</h3>

    <p>Aerosure medic combines these two therapies in one convenient device. It uniquely delivers Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) designed to improve respiratory fitness, and Oscillating (or vibrating) Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) designed to clear mucus from the lungs. Up until now, these functions have not been available in one device. Because Aerosure is electrically driven, unlike other devices it is effective regardless of the angle it's used in or the pressure generated by the user.</p>

    <h3 style="margin: 1.5em 0 0.5em;font-size: 1.5em;color: #005ea1;">Unique device with two beneficial functions</h3>

    <p>Aerosure Medic has 2 simple and easy to use modes.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 1em 0 0.5em;">For mucus relief 15 Hz <img style="margin: -3px 0 0 5px;" src="{{media url="asm_uk/blocks/mucus_relief_2.png"}}" alt="Mucus Relief Mode" /></h4>
    <p>In this setting the vibrations transmitted to the chest wall help to dislodge the mucus from the airways and lungs. Use for 15 â€“ 20 breaths as required.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 1em 0 0.5em;">For breathe easier 25Hz <img style="margin: -3px 0 0 0;" src="{{media url="asm_uk/blocks/breather-easier_2.png"}}" alt="Breathe Easier Mode" /></h4>
    <p>In this setting the resistance creates an increase in the pressure in the lungs and targets the muscles of the respiratory system. This helps to keep the airways wide open as well as working the breathing muscles harder, which helps to reduce breathlessness with regular use. Use for 5 minutes twice a day.</p>
