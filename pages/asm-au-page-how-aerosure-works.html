<h1>How Aerosure Works</h1>
<div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 30px 20px;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nxm2EWE28JQ?wmode=opaque;rel=0" frameborder="0" height="177" width="315"></iframe></div>
<p>Aerosure Medic works by spinning a valve inside the device at high speed to rapidly open and close the flow of air in to and out of the lungs. This mode of action is referred to as high frequency airways oscillation (HFAO). As you breathe through the mouthpiece the oscillating valve creates a resistance, vibrating the chest wall to work the lung muscles harder and improve respiratory fitness. Aerosure Medic is electrically driven; effective regardless of the angle of position of use or the pressure generated by the user.</p>
<p>Aerosure has 2 settings which can be selected depending on the treatment you require.</p>

<h2>The Mucus Relief Mode, 15hz <span><img style="margin: 8px 0 0 5px;" src="{{media url="asm_uk/blocks/mucus_relief_2.png"}}" alt="Mucus Relief Mode" /></span></h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 35px;">Aerosure transmits vibrations via the spinning valve to the chest wall to help dislodge mucus from the airways and lungs. The 15Hz setting is comparable to the natural motion of cilia (cilia are small hair-like structures found in your lungs and airways that move in a sweeping motion to help clear mucus and foreign particles).</p>
<h3>For Mucus Relief</h3>
<ol>
<li><span>Turn Aerosure on by holding down the power button for 2 seconds. The mucus relief symbol will now be lit and you will hear the motor run.</span></li>
<li><span>Place the mouthpiece in your mouth sealing your lips around the shield to create a seal.</span></li>
<li><span>Breathe through Aerosure as per user manual and then remove the device from your mouth before coughing to clear the mucus.</span></li>
</ol></div>
<div style="float: right; margin: 25px 90px 0;"><img src="{{media url="asm_uk/howitworks/asm-uk-howitworks-breathe-01.jpg"}}" alt="Turning on device and choosing Breathe Easier Mode" /></div>
<div style="width: 650px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
<h2>The Breathe Easier Mode, 25hz <span><img style="margin: 8px 0 0 5px;" src="{{media url="asm_uk/blocks/breather-easier_2.png"}}" alt="Breathe Easier Mode" /></span></h2>
<p>Resistance creates an increase in lung pressure and targets the muscles of the respiratory system. This helps to work the respiratory system to help keep airways open, as well as working breathing muscles harder, which with regular use improves respiratory fitness and may result in reduced breathlessness.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Turn Aerosure on by holding down the power button for 2 seconds.</span></li>
<li><span>Then press the power button once more to select the Breathe Easier mode. The Breathe Easier symbol will now be lit and you will hear the motor increase in speed.</span></li>
<li><span>Place the mouthpiece in your mouth sealing your lips around the shield to create a seal.</span></li>
<li><span>Breathe through Aerosure as per users manual.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Once your session is complete, press the power button to turn it off.</p>
<p>Always read the label. Refer to the user&rsquo;s guide for further information.</p>

<h2>Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT)</h2>
<p>Inspiratory Muscle Training is a technique used to increase respiratory fitness by improving the performance of the muscles involved in inhalation.</p>
<p>Aerosure Medic is designed to rapidly interrupt airflow, causing airflow resistance, making Aerosure comparable to other inspiratory muscle training devices. This is supported by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its similarity in physiological outcomes to IMT in other available respiratory devices</li>
<li>Clinical study data for Aerosure Medic and comparable respiratory devices</li>
</ul>
<h2>Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP)</h2>
<p>Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) devices help inhaled air get behind mucus in the lungs so that mucus can be expelled through coughing/huffing. Oscillating PEP (OPEP) works in the same way as PEP with the additional benefit of oscillation, which causes vibrations to help dislodge the mucus from the airways and lungs before it is cleared through coughing.</p>
<p>This is supported by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its similarity in terms of mode of action in OPEP</li>
<li>Clinical study data for Aerosure and comparable devices</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unique Features of Aerosure</h2>
<p>Aerosure Medic is designed to overcome the performance limitations of some other PEP devices as it is electrically driven. Other comparable devices are dependent on the user holding the product at the correct angle and achieving the correct exhalation pressure in order to prove effective. As Aerosure is electrically driven it is effective regardless of the position of the device and pressure generated by the user.</p>
<p>The frequency of the rotating valve is set by the speed of the motor, and is not affected by the exhalation pressure generated by the user.</p>
<p>Aerosure operates at a frequency to aid mucus clearance, regardless of technique.</p>
