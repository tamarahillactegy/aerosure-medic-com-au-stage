    <p>Many people experience breathlessness at some time. This could simply be after heavy exercise or exertion you are not used to. This can happen more often when people are unused to exercise. If your symptoms of breathlessness continue and/or get worse you should consult your healthcare professional.</p>
    <p>Breathlessness as a medical symptom is an unpleasant awareness of difficult or uncomfortable breathing that is greater than you would normally expect during exercise.</p>
    <p>Breathlessness is sometimes referred to as dyspnoea (pronounced disp-NEE-a), Greek for difficulty in breathing.</p>
